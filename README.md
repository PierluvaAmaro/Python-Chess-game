## 🎮 Game Description

This is a fully playable **Chess game** implemented in Python. The game includes:

- Standard **8x8 chessboard**
- Complete set of pieces for both players
- Turn-based gameplay enforcing standard chess rules
- Basic AI support (depending on configuration in Ruff)
- Text-based interface compatible with the UV environment

## ⚙️ Implemented Chess Functions

The game implements the following functionalities:

- **Move Validation** – Ensures that all moves follow standard chess rules for each piece.  
- **Check & Checkmate Detection** – Detects when a king is under threat and determines checkmate conditions.  
- **Castling** – Implements short and long castling rules.  
- **Pawn Promotion** – Allows pawns to be promoted when reaching the opposite rank.  
- **En Passant** – Supports en passant captures for pawns.  
- **Turn Management** – Alternates moves between white and black players.  
- **Game State Tracking** – Keeps track of moves, captured pieces, and the current board state.
